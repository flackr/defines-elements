    <h1>defines-elements polyfill</h1>
    <p>This is a polyfill of the defines-elements concept. When a script is
    declared to define types of elements those elements are hidden until the
    script has loaded.</p>

    <p>If after the script had loaded, the element type is still not defined,
    an error is logged to the console to indicate to the developer that they
    failed to define the element.</p>

    <p>If you refresh the page you should not see the text "Test button"
    unstyled</p>

    <fancy-button>
      <span slot="label">Test button</span>
    </fancy-button>
